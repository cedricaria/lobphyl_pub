## General

<ol>

<li><b>Paired limbs</b>

	 0	Absent

	 1	Present

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c1.

<li><b>External subdivision of integument </b>

	 0	Annulated

	 1	Segmented

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c2. 

<li><b>Type of integumental segmentation </b>

	 0	Segmented but not sclerotic

	 1	Arthrodized (=tergo-sclerotic)

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c3.

## Anterior section

<li><b>Pillar structure in the epicuticle</b>

	 0	Absent

	 1	Present

> *Remark*: See KA2023-c4.

<li><b>Invaginable head separated from trunk by numerous spines arranged radially</b>

	 0	Absent

	 1	Present

> *Remark*: See KA2023-c5,6. Re-worded for coding logic and inapplicable for taxa with arthrodized bodies.

<li><b>Anteriorization including differentiated limbs</b>

	 0	Absent

	 1	Present

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c4. Following KA2023, we do not explicitly code the tardigrade stylet as a modified appendage; however, we also do not consider that heterotardigrades can be characterized by an anatomical anteriorization involving limbs. KA2023 posited that the developmentally truncated portion of the ancestral tardigrade trunk hides an antero-posterior pseudo-tagmatization similar to that of luolishaniids; even if this is verified, our coding is justified as representing the tardigrade autapomorphic condition.

	 1	Present

> *Remark*: The development of sub-apical integumental rings or plates is a feature of luolishaniids. See AC2024 for a detailed discussion about this character.

<li><b> Median spine above limb insertions</b>

<li><b>Sternites</b>

	 0	Absent
	
	 1	Present

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c42. Ventral plates in certain heterotardigrades can be expressed as several sets of pairs or more (see, e.g., Kaczmarek et al. 2012), suggesting that they may convergent with sternites rather than homologous with them, although this is not always the case (Fontoura et al. 2017). However, ascertaining this will require a more detailed comparison of the genetic-developmental pathways of expression of arthropod sternites and tardigrade ventral plates. We therefore code the state as uncertain in heterotardigrades.

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c47.

<li><b> Lobopod spinules paired in a chevron-shaped pattern</b>
	
	 0	Absent
	
	 1	Present

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c48. 

<li><b> Type of chevron-arranged spinules</b>

	 0	Short (ca. twice as long as lobopod diameter or less), spaced by at least half of lobopod diameter (irrespective of smaller intermediary spines).

	 1	Long (up to 2.5 times lobopod diameter), spaced by ca. 1/3 of lobopod diameter.

> *Remark*: See CA2020-c50.

<li><b> Posterior tapering of lobopods</b>

	 0	Absent

	 1	Present

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c49.

<li><b> Bipartite appendage</b>

	 0	Absent

	 1	Present

	 0	Distinct, subtraight or slightly curved claws

	 1	Set of four or more slender claws with strongly-curved tips

	 2	Pad / foot

	 1	Two

	 2	Three

	 3	Four

	 4	More than four

> *Remark*: Modified, from CA2017-c51.

## Limb spacing and posterior section

<li><b> Lobopodous trunk posterior termination type</b>

	 0	Vestigial (“truncated”)

	 1	Well-developed

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c52.

<li><b> Interspace between lobopods in the anterior section of body</b>

	 0	Subequal

	 1	Increasing posteriad

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c53. 

<li><b> Interspace between lobopods in the posterior section of body</b>

	 0	Subequal

	 1	Increasing anteriad

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c54. KA2023 considered this character to be inapplicable in tardigrades, yet there is an obviously greater distance separating the posteriormost pair from the penultimate than the distance between other limb pairs.

<li><b> Number of limb pairs affected by the reduction of posterior interspace</b>

	 0	Two (penultimate and last)

> *Remark*: See CA2017-c59.

	 1	Present

> *Remark*: See KA2023-c118. Conditions in *Entothyreos* and echiniscoideans are coded here as homologous, although it is not known whether the plate-like imbricated annuli of *Entothyreos* have a similar histological origin as those in tardigrades.
